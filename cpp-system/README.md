# Ultra Low-Latency C++ System

A high-performance C++ system designed to achieve sub-millisecond response times for critical operations in blog and media management platforms.

## Features

- **Ultra-Fast API Gateway**: DPDK-based HTTP server with sub-500Î¼s response times
- **Lock-Free Cache**: In-memory cache with RCU semantics and nanosecond access times
- **Real-Time Stream Processor**: SIMD-accelerated event processing at 10M+ events/sec
- **GPU Compute Engine**: CUDA-based acceleration for ML inference and media processing
- **Performance Monitor**: Hardware counter integration with nanosecond precision

## Requirements

### System Requirements
- Linux (Ubuntu 22.04+ recommended)
- x86_64 architecture with AVX2 support
- 16GB+ RAM
- NVMe SSD storage
- NVIDIA GPU (optional, for GPU acceleration)

### Software Dependencies
- CMake 3.20+
- GCC 11+ or Clang 14+
- CUDA Toolkit 12.0+ (optional)
- DPDK 22.0+
- Python 3.8+ (for Conan)

## Quick Start

### 1. Setup Development Environment

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd cpp-system

# Run setup script (requires sudo for system configuration)
sudo ./scripts/setup-dev-env.sh
./scripts/setup-dev-env.sh

# Build the project
./scripts/build.sh Release
```

### 2. Configuration

Edit `config/ultra-cpp.conf` to customize system settings:

```ini
[api_gateway]
port = 8080
worker_threads = 0  # auto-detect
memory_pool_size = 1073741824  # 1GB

[cache]
capacity = 1000000
shard_count = 64
```

### 3. Running with Docker

```bash
# Build and run with Docker Compose
docker-compose up --build

# Or build Docker image manually
docker build -t ultra-cpp .
docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 9090:9090 --privileged ultra-cpp
```

## Architecture

The system consists of several high-performance components:

- **API Gateway**: Handles HTTP requests with DPDK networking
- **Cache Layer**: Lock-free in-memory cache with RDMA replication
- **Stream Processor**: Real-time event processing with SIMD
- **GPU Compute**: CUDA-accelerated ML inference and media processing
- **Monitoring**: Hardware performance counter integration

## Performance Targets

- **API Latency**: P99 < 1ms at 1M+ QPS
- **Cache Access**: < 100ns for hot data
- **Stream Processing**: 10M+ events/sec per core
- **Memory Throughput**: 10GB/s+ on NVMe storage

## Development

### Building

```bash
# Debug build
./scripts/build.sh Debug

# Release build with optimizations
./scripts/build.sh Release

# Clean build
./scripts/build.sh Release clean
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
cd build/Release
ctest --output-on-failure

# Run specific test suite
./bin/unit_tests
./bin/benchmark_tests
./bin/integration_tests
```

### Profiling

```bash
# CPU profiling with perf
perf record -g ./bin/ultra-api-gateway
perf report

# Memory profiling with Valgrind
valgrind --tool=massif ./bin/ultra-api-gateway
```

## Integration

The C++ system integrates with existing Node.js infrastructure:

- **Fallback Mechanism**: Automatic fallback to Node.js for complex operations
- **Shared Cache**: Redis integration for cross-system state
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics export
- **Configuration**: Hot-reloadable configuration system
